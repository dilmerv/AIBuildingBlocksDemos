# 🤖 AI Building Blocks Demos

This project was created to test the [AI Building Blocks](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-ai-building-blocks-overview/) features released as of Meta SDKs v83+. This repo will include samples demonstrated during my [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8BFLkRYOy0&list=PLQMQNmwN3FvxzH_peK5P4oLQsNjWTPfhv) including Object Detection, Large Language Models (LLMs), Text To Speech (TTS), and Speech To Text (STT).

## 💻 System Recommendations 
- Unity 6 or newer
- Meta Quest 3 or 3s
- Meta XR Core SDK v83+ and Meta XR MR UtilityKit v83+ (for Passthrough Camera support)
- Stable internet connection when running cloud providers
